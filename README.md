```
1. It is done when my page has correctly linked Bootstrap, jQuery, and other libraries I may be using for this project.
2. It is done when I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".
3. Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".
4. Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".
5. Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".
6. On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".
7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
8. When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
10. The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered.
11. Make sure to have a ReadMe file with your application information.
